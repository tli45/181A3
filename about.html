            <h2>Motivation & Mindset</h2>
            <p><em>"The best skater is the one having the most fun."</em></p>
            <p>The ollie is more than just a skateboarding trick—it’s a gateway to creativity, freedom, and self-expression. Many skaters struggle to understand the science behind it, even after hours of practice. Our motivation was to bridge this gap by revealing the physics and mechanics that make the ollie possible. By understanding how force, momentum, and motion interact, we hope learners can train smarter and progress faster.</p>

            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>This project was created by a group of engineering students passionate about both skateboarding and physics. It breaks down the ollie into its fundamental components, using diagrams, force analysis, and real-world applications to explain each phase of the motion. Whether you’re a beginner skater or a curious learner, this site aims to help you understand the ollie from both a technical and practical perspective.</p>
